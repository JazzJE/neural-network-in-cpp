	**KEY THINGS TO NOTE WHEN INTERACTING WITH THIS PROGRAM**

	- This program is hard-written with a single neuron for output (meaning that you should only be predicting one value)

	- In the csv dataset file that you will parse, make sure...
		
		1. That the last column is the column that you want to predict (i.e., if you want to predict house prices, then 
		every column except the last will be the house features, and then the last column will be the actual house prices)
		
		2. ***** THAT EVERY FIELD ONLY CONSISTS OF NUMBER VALUES *****; do not have strings/words/letters in the dataset 
		(i.e., do not have a column of strings like "name of house owner" and have every field underneath be strings like 
		"Jack Fry" or "Jill" or "ioenhaoea")
